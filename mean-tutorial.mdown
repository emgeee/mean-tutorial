# Introduction

{intro-video: mean-intro}

The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through the creation of a
Reddit/Hacker News clone using the MEAN stack. By completing this tutorial, you
will gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST
interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform
CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.


## Why MEAN Stack?

The acronym "MEAN" stands for "[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)" and represents a group of technologies which are
known to synergize well together. The major benefit of the MEAN stack is that
it's extremely quick to prototype with. Node.js allows you to use Javascript on
the backend as well as the frontend which can save you from having to learn a
separate language. In addition, the
[NoSQL](http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) nature of MongoDB allows you to
quickly change and alter the data layer without having to worry about
migrations, which is a very valuable attribute when you're trying to build a
product without clear specifications. Finally, these technologies have a lot
of community support behind them so finding answers to questions or hiring help
is going to be much easier using these technologies.


## Prerequisites

This course assumes knowledge of programming and at least basic knowledge of
JavaScript. In addition, you should be comfortable with basic web application
concepts including [REST][] and [CRUD][]. Before you begin, you will also need
to have Node.js and MongoDB already installed. Because you will need to install
various packages for Node.js, you should follow [these installation
instructions][install-node] which use [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).
Installation instructions for MongoDB can be found [on the Mongo
website][install-mongo]. This tutorial will be based on AngularJS v1.3.10,
Node.js v0.10.31 and MongoDB 2.6.7.


{x: install node}
Install Node.js

{x: install mongo}
Install MongoDB


## Recommendations for Completing this Tutorial

Throughout the course of this tutorial, links to additional concepts and
information will be included. You can use these links as supplementary material
which can help you gain insight into the stack and its various components. As
always, if you have any questions Google and
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) are your best bet. If you're unsure
about something specific to this tutorial, feel free to ping me on twitter
at [@IAmMattGreen](https://twitter.com/IAmMattGreen)!

We at Thinkster are firm believers in actually writing code. Therefor we
**strongly** encourage you to type out all the code instead of copy+pasting it.


## Project Specifications

Before beginning work on any project, it's usually a good idea to know what you're
building. Below is a basic list of things we want our users to be able to do:

* Create new posts
* View all posts ordered by upvotes
* Add comments about a given post
* View comments for a given post
* Upvote posts and comments


In addition to technologies that make up MEAN, we're going to enlist the help
of several other libraries to help us achieve our goals:

* [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/) for adding structure to MongoDB
* [Angular ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) for client-side routing
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for some quick styling



# Jumping in with Angular

{video: ch-1}

To begin this tutorial, we're going to start with the Angular side of things.
AngularJS is a frontend framework developed by Google with the goal of making
single page web applications easier to build, test, and maintain. Throughout
this tutorials, we'll be linking to our [A Better Way to Learn Angular][better
way] guide which can provide supplementary information.

Without further ado, let's jump in...


## Getting Started

As mentioned before, this tutorial will take you through building out a Hacker
News/Reddit clone, which we're going to name "Flapper News". To keep things
simple, we're going to kick things off with two files.


{x: create basic angular app}
Create two empty files called `index.html` (for writing the template) and `app.js` (for defining our AngularJS logic)

To begin, our `index.html` will look like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Angular App!</title>
    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.10/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body ng-app="flapperNews" ng-controller="MainCtrl">
    <div>
      {{test}}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Our `app.js` is going to look like this:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('flapperNews', []);

app.controller('MainCtrl', [
'$scope',
function($scope){
  $scope.test = 'Hello world!';
}]);
```

With these several lines of code, we've set up a new AngularJS app and created
a new controller. You'll notice that we declare a variable `test` in the controller and display its contents
using the AngularJS `{{}}` notation. This is demonstrating one of the most powerful features of
AngularJS, which is its two-way data-bindings.



{x: understand data bindings}
If you aren't familiar with data-binding in AngularJS, read the AngularJS Guide on [ two-way data-binding ][data bindings]


## Displaying Lists

One thing that's is going to be absolutely fundamental to our app is displaying
lists. Fortunately, angular makes this really easy using the
[ng-repeat][] directive.


{x: add scope posts array}
To begin, we're going to modify our
controller to include a new `$scope` variable that defines a list of post
titles. Add the following code inside the controller function in `app.js`:

```javascript
$scope.posts = [
  'post 1',
  'post 2',
  'post 3',
  'post 4',
  'post 5'
];
```

{info}
The `$scope` variable serves as the bridge between Angular controllers and
Angular templates. If you want something to be accessible in the template such
as a function or variable, bind it to `$scope`


{x: using ng-repeat}
Now that we have a list of data we want to repeat, let's use `ng-repeat` to do it. Add the following code to line 8 of index.html,
replacing the div that was there before:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts">
  {{post}}
</div>
```

When you refresh the page you should see a list of posts!

Now what if we want to display additional information about our posts?
`ng-repeat` lets us do that too!


{x: amend posts objects}
Let's amend our `posts` object to include some
additional information we might be interested in displaying like the number of
upvotes:

```javascript
$scope.posts = [
  {title: 'post 1', upvotes: 5},
  {title: 'post 2', upvotes: 2},
  {title: 'post 3', upvotes: 15},
  {title: 'post 4', upvotes: 9},
  {title: 'post 5', upvotes: 4}
];
```


{x: display posts objects}
Now we change our `ng-repeat` directive to display the new information:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts">
  {{post.title}} - upvotes: {{post.upvotes}}
</div>
```

Of course it is important to order posts by number of upvotes, and we can tap
into an [angular filter][filters] to make it happen.


{x: filter data}
Add a filter to our posts based on the number of upvotes in descending order:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts | orderBy: '-upvotes'">
  {{post.title}} - upvotes: {{post.upvotes}}
</div>
```

AngularJS comes with several [built in filters][built in filters] but you can
also write custom filters tailored to your specific needs.


# Getting User Input

{video: ch-2}

Now that we've learned how to display lists of information with Angular,
it'd really be great if we could have the user add posts. To do this,
we first need to add a function to our `$scope` variable.


{x: create addpost function}
Create a $scope function that will add an object into the posts array:

```javascript
$scope.addPost = function(){
  $scope.posts.push({title: 'A new post!', upvotes: 0});
};
```

When this function is invoked, it will append a new post to our `$scope.posts`
variable. Now we're going to have to allow the user to actually execute this
function.


{x: create addpost button}
Create a button that executes our addPost $scope function using the [ng-click][ng-click] directive:

```html
<button ng-click="addPost()">Post</button>
```

Great, we can now click a button and have a new post show up! Let's extend this
by allowing the user to actually specify what they want the title to be. First,
we need to build out the form in HTML and sprinkle it with some Angular Magic.

{x: form with ng-submit}
Create a form below the ng-repeat div that will allow us to enter custom posts:

```html
<form ng-submit="addPost()">
  <input type="text" ng-model="title"></input>
  <button type="submit">Post</button>
</form>
```

Here we've created a form that encompasses our title text-box and 'Post' button.
We are also now calling our `addPost()` function using the
[ng-submit][ng-submit] directive, which has the added benefit of the user being
able to press the 'enter' key to submit the form. Finally, we're using the
[ng-model][ng-model] directive to bind the contents of the text box to
`$scope`. This will allow our controller to access the contents of the text box
using `$scope.title`.

To accompany the changes to our template, we need to make some tweaks to
`addPost()`.


{x: tweak addPost}
Have the addPost function retrieve the title entered into our form, which is bound to the $scope variable `title`, and set `title` to blank once it has been added to the posts array:

```Javascript
$scope.addPost = function(){
  $scope.posts.push({title: $scope.title, upvotes: 0});
  $scope.title = '';
};
```

When we add a post we are now getting the title from `$scope.title`, which we
then clear after the post has been created. At this point, it makes sense to
prevent the user from posting a blank title.


{x: prevent blank title}
Prevent a user from submitting a post with a blank title by adding the
following line to the beginning of `addPost()`:

```javascript
if(!$scope.title || $scope.title === '') { return; }
```

## Enable Upvoting

Now that we can add some new posts, why don't we allow a user to upvote
existing ones?  To get started, lets revisit our `ng-repeat` directive.


{x: add upvote span}
Next to each post, we need to place a click-able element that will increment the
corresponding post's upvote counter:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts | orderBy:'-upvotes'">
  <span ng-click="incrementUpvotes(post)">^</span>
  {{post.title}} - upvotes: {{post.upvotes}}
</div>
```

We've now added a `^` character inside a `<span>` tag that when clicked, calls
the `incrementUpvotes()` function in our controller, but we don't have
that function in our controller yet!


{x: add upvote function}
Define the `incrementUpvotes()` function in our controller:

```javascript
$scope.incrementUpvotes = function(post) {
  post.upvotes += 1;
};
```

Notice that for this function we are passing the current instance of `post` to
the function. This is happening [by reference][object reference] so when we
increment upvotes, it gets automatically reflected back to the HTML page.

## Submitting Links

Ultimately, Flapper News is about sharing links to content, so lets enable users
to submit links along with their titles. We'll start by adding a second text box
to our form that a user can use to submit a link. We'll also add some placeholder
text to make it clear which form is which:


{x: link text field}
Add a link field to our form that is bound to the scope variable `link`:

```javascript
<form ng-submit="addPost()">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Title" ng-model="title"></input>
  <br>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Link" ng-model="link"></input>
  <br>
  <button type="submit">Post</button>
</form>
```


{x: extend addPost for links}
Next we're going to want to modify our `addPost()` function to include the link
(notice that we aren't going to force the user to submit a link if they don't
want to):

```javascript
$scope.addPost = function(){
  if(!$scope.title || $scope.title === '') { return; }
  $scope.posts.push({
    title: $scope.title,
    link: $scope.link,
    upvotes: 0
  });
  $scope.title = '';
  $scope.link = '';
};
```

Finally we need to modify the `ng-repeat` section to make the title a link
to the content, but only if a link was specified.

We'll do this by using a new directive called [ng-hide][], which hides elements
when an [Angular expression][] evaluates to true.


{x: hide blank link}
Use to `ng-hide` to hide the linked version of the
title if no link exists and correspondingly show the unlinked version:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts | orderBy:'-upvotes'">
  <span ng-click="incrementUpvotes(post)">^</span>
  <a ng-show="post.link" href="{{post.link}}">
    {{post.title}}
  </a>
  <span ng-hide="post.link">
    {{post.title}}
  </span>
  - upvotes: {{post.upvotes}}
</div>
```

It is worth noting that [ng-show][] is merely the inverse of `ng-hide`. You can
use either one for programmatically displaying or hiding elements.

# Adding Some Style

{video: ch-3_4}

At this point, we have the basics of an application - a user can add new posts
which are automatically ordered based on the number of upvotes. Up until now,
however, our interface has been lacking in the looks department. We can spruce
it up a bit using some basic Bootstrap styling.


{x: use bootstrap}
Change your `index.html` file to include Twitter Bootstrap along with a new layout:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Flapper News</title>
  <link href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

  <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.10/angular.min.js"></script>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
  <style> .glyphicon-thumbs-up { cursor:pointer } </style>
</head>
<body ng-app="flapperNews" ng-controller="MainCtrl">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Flapper News</h1>
      </div>

      <div ng-repeat="post in posts | orderBy:'-upvotes'">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"
          ng-click="incrementUpvotes(post)"></span>
        {{post.upvotes}}
        <span style="font-size:20px; margin-left:10px;">
          <a ng-show="post.link" href="{{post.link}}">
            {{post.title}}
          </a>
          <span ng-hide="post.link">
            {{post.title}}
          </span>
        </span>
      </div>

      <form ng-submit="addPost()"
        style="margin-top:30px;">
        <h3>Add a new post</h3>

        <div class="form-group">
          <input type="text"
            class="form-control"
            placeholder="Title"
            ng-model="title"></input>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
          <input type="text"
          class="form-control"
          placeholder="Link"
          ng-model="link"></input>
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Post</button>
      </form>

    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

At the top we've included Bootstrap from a
[CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). In the body tag,
we've made use of Bootstrap's [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)
to align our content in the middle of the screen. We've also stylized the posts
list and "Add a new post" form to make things a little easier to read. There's
a lot more that could be done on this front so feel free to mess around with
more styling before (or after) you continue.


{x: add own styles}
(optional) Add your own styles!

# Angular Services

Up to this point, we've been storing important data directly in the controller.
While this works, it has some disadvantages:

* when the controller goes out of scope, we lose the data
* that data cannot be easily accessed from other controllers or directives
* the data is difficult to mock, which is important when writing automated tests

To rectify this problem, we're going to refactor our `$scope.posts` variable into a
[service][services].



## My First Service... Is Really a Factory

In Angular, services are declared much like controllers. Inside `app.js`,
we're going to attach a new service to our `flapperNews` module.


{x: create factory}
Create a factory for posts in `app.js` (our `MainCtrl` controller should appear below this):

```javascript
app.factory('posts', [function(){
  // service body
}])
```

{info}
By [Angular conventions][angular style guide], lowerCamelCase is used for
factory names that won't be `new`'ed.

You may be wondering why we're using the keyword *factory* instead of
*service*.  In angular, factory and service are related in that they are both
instances of a third entity called *provider*.


{x: different types of services}
The difference between them are nuanced but if you'd like to learn more check out [Angular Factory vs Service vs Provider][factory vs service].

{x: move posts to factory}
Now that we've created our service, lets go ahead and move our posts variable to
it:

```javascript
app.factory('posts', [function(){
  var o = {
    posts: []
  };
  return o;
}]);
```

What we're doing here is creating a new object that has an array property
called `posts`. We then return that variable so that our `o` object essentially
becomes exposed to any other Angular module that cares to inject it. You'll
note that we could have simply exported the `posts` array directly, however, by
exporting an object that contains the `posts` array we can add new objects and
methods to our services in the future.


## Injecting the Service

Our next step is to inject the service into our controller so we can access its
data.  Simply add the name of the service as a parameter to the controller we
wish to access it from:


{x: inject post service}
Inject posts service into `MainCtrl`

```javascript
app.controller('MainCtrl', [
'$scope',
'posts',
function($scope, posts){
  ...

)};
```

As you'll recall, two-way data-binding only applies to variables bound to
`$scope`. To display our array of posts that exist in the posts factory
(`posts.posts`), we'll need to set a scope variable in our controller to mirror
the array returned from the service.


{x: mirror posts}
Bind the `$scope.posts` variable in our controller to the posts array in our service:

```javascript
$scope.posts = posts.posts;
```

Now any change or modification made to `$scope.posts` will be stored in the
service and immediately accessible by any other module that injects the `posts`
service.

# Angular Routing

{video: ch-5}


Now that we understand the basics of Angular templates, controllers, and
services, we're going to start diving into some of the concepts that make
client side web applications so dynamic and powerful. To do this, we're going
to need to learn how to deal with multiple views and controllers, which we will
accomplish using the wonderful
[ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/) library.


{x: add ui-router}
To get started, lets include the library after we include Angular in our
`index.html`:

```html
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-ui-router/0.2.10/angular-ui-router.js"></script>
```


{x: include ui-router}
Because we are adding an external module, we need to be sure to include it as a
dependency in our app:

```javascript
angular.module('flapperNews', ['ui.router'])
```

You may be wondering why we have chosen to use `ui-router` instead of the more
standard [ngRoute][ng-route] module - `ui-router` is newer and provides more
flexibility and features than `ngRoute`. We will be using a few of these in
this tutorial.


## Adding a New State

Now that we have `ui-router` included, we need to configure it. In our
`app.js`, we're going to use the Angular `config()` function to setup a
*home* state.


{x: configure home state}
Create the config block for our app and configure a home state using [$stateProvider](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki) and [$urlRouterProvider](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/URL-Routing). Use `otherwise()` to redirect unspecified routes.

```javascript
app.config([
'$stateProvider',
'$urlRouterProvider',
function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {

  $stateProvider
    .state('home', {
      url: '/home',
      templateUrl: '/home.html',
      controller: 'MainCtrl'
    });

  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('home');
}]);
```

Here we set up our *home* route. You'll notice that the state is given a name
('home'), URL ('/home'), and template URL ('/home.html'). We've also told
Angular that our new state should be controlled by `MainCtrl`. Finally, using
the [otherwise()][ui otherwise] method we've specified what should happen if
the app receives a URL that is not defined. All that's left to do is define the
`home.html` template. Instead of creating a new file, we are going to move most
of our HTML into an [inline template][].


{x: add home template}
Add our inline home template right before the `</body>` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="/home.html">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Flapper News</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- rest of template -->
</script>
```

Using this syntax we can create templates inside our HTML and reference them
in JavaScript.

Finally, we need to tell `ui-router` where to place the template of the active
state.


{x: insert ui-view}
Insert the `<ui-view>` tag where template should be rendered:

```html
<body ng-app="flapperNews">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
      <ui-view></ui-view>
    </div>
  </div>

  ...
```

Whenever `ui-router` detects a route change, it will place the new state's
template inside the [<ui-view>][ui view] tag and initialize the controller we specified
in our state configuration. Notice how we have removed the
`ng-controller="MainCtrl"` line from the opening `<body>` tag.

# The Posts Page

{video: ch-6}

Now that we've figured out how to create a state with `ui-router`, let's create
a new one called *posts* that will display comments associated with a post.


{x: create posts state}
In the config block in `app.js`, add a state where an individual post can be accessed:

```javascript
.state('posts', {
  url: '/posts/{id}',
  templateUrl: '/posts.html',
  controller: 'PostsCtrl'
});
```

Notice that we define our URL with brackets around 'id'. This means that 'id'
is actually a [route parameter][ui parameters] that will be made available to our controller.

As with the *home* state, we're also going to need to define both a new
template and a new controller. Because we're going to associate comments with
posts, we want to ensure our `posts` factory is injected into this controller
so that it may access the comments data.


{x: create posts ctrl}
Create a new controller in `app.js` called PostsCtrl and be sure to inject the `posts` service:

```javascript
app.controller('PostsCtrl', [
'$scope',
'$stateParams',
'posts',
function($scope, $stateParams, posts){

}]);
```

## Faking comment data

Before we go any further, let's take a second to add some fake comment
data to our `posts` model. This will help us mock up the basic comments
view as well as ensure our routing is working properly.


{x: add fake comments}
In our addPost function in MainCtrl, add an array of fake comments to the posts object:

```javascript
$scope.posts.push({
  title: $scope.title,
  link: $scope.link,
  upvotes: 0,
  comments: [
    {author: 'Joe', body: 'Cool post!', upvotes: 0},
    {author: 'Bob', body: 'Great idea but everything is wrong!', upvotes: 0}
  ]
});
```

## Getting the Right Post

Since the *posts* page is about viewing the comments on a particular post, we
need to use the `id` route parameter to grab the post and associated
information. For now, we will consider the index of the post to be its id. We
can use [$stateParams][ui stateParams] to retrieve the id from the URL and load the appropriate
post.


{x: get postid from stateparams}
In PostsCtrl, set a scope object called `post` that grabs the appropriate post from the `posts` service using the id from $stateParams:

```javascript
$scope.post = posts.posts[$stateParams.id];
```

Now that we have the `post` variable in our controller, we can display that
information in our template.


{x: create posts template}
Create a new inline template called "/posts.html" in `index.html` right before the `</body>` tag:

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="/posts.html">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h3>
      <a ng-show="post.link" href="{{post.link}}">
        {{post.title}}
      </a>
      <span ng-hide="post.link">
        {{post.title}}
      </span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div ng-repeat="comment in post.comments | orderBy:'-upvotes'">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"
      ng-click="incrementUpvotes(comment)"></span>
    {{comment.upvotes}} - by {{comment.author}}
    <span style="font-size:20px; margin-left:10px;">
      {{comment.body}}
    </span>
  </div>
</script>
```



Finally, we'll add a link to the post's comment page next to the headline on the
front page.


{x: add cmt link}
In the "/home.html" inline template, add the code below right after the title `</span>` tag:

```html
<span>
  <a href="#/posts/{{$index}}">Comments</a>
</span>
```

{info}
When iterating over an array, the `ng-repeat` directive makes an `$index`
variable available along with each item in the array.


## Creating New Comments

As with the creation of posts, we're going to want to allow our users to post new
comments. This code looks very similar to what we've already written:


{x: create addComment function}
In our controller `PostsCtrl`, create an `addComment()` function:

```javascript
$scope.addComment = function(){
  if($scope.body === '') { return; }
  $scope.post.comments.push({
    body: $scope.body,
    author: 'user',
    upvotes: 0
  });
  $scope.body = '';
};
```

{x: create addComment form}
Add the form below at the end of our inline template "/posts.html":

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="/posts.html">

  <!-- post template -->

  <form ng-submit="addComment()"
    style="margin-top:30px;">
    <h3>Add a new comment</h3>

    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="text"
      class="form-control"
      placeholder="Comment"
      ng-model="body"></input>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Post</button>
  </form>
</script>
```


## Recap

In this first section, we've introduced you to some of the very basics of
Angular.js including data-binding, controllers, services, and routing. In the
process, we've created a skeleton web application that allows a user to create
a posting that can contain a link or a title, then create comments that are
associated with those postings.

Up next we're going to learn how to use Node.js to implement a basic REST API
for saving and retrieving posts and comments. Then we'll come back to the
frontend and wire everything together into a single cohesive and functional web
application.

# Beginning Node

{video: ch-7}

Now that we have the basic front-end for our Flapper News coded up with
Angular, we're going to start work on our backend. Because Angular is able to
handle the templating and rendering, our backend server will mainly serve as a
communication layer with our database. Over the next few sections, we are going
to focus on modeling our data needs and creating a REST API that our Angular
app can use to interact with this data.

If you haven't already done so, make sure you have `node`, `npm`, and `mongodb`
installed on your system. As a quick reminder, this tutorial assumes Node
v0.10.31 and MongoDB 2.6.7.


## Creating A New Project

{x: install express-generator}
We will begin by using [express's generator][express generator]. We can install this using
the following command:

```bash
npm install -g express-generator
```


{x: create node project}
Now we can initiate a new node project with the following command:

```bash
express --ejs flapper-news
cd flapper-news
```

This will create a new folder called *flapper-news* and populate it with
various files and folders.

{info}
We are passing the `--ejs` flag because we'd like like our server to use
standard HTML in its templates as opposed *jade*. Theoretically we are free to
use Jade if we'd like to but the front-end is already written in plain HTML.

Our first order of business is to add the relevant npm modules we're going to
need. When starting a new project, a generator will include a list of packages
that are required by default.


{x: npm install}
Install these packages using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will automatically download any packages specified in the `packages.json`
file and store them in the `node_modules/` directory.

Next, we are going to install Mongoose, which is a library that provides
schemas and models on top of MongoDB.


{x: install mongoose}
Run this command to install Mongoose via npm:

```bash
npm install --save mongoose
```

{info}
The `--save` flag passed to npm install instructs the program to also save the
package to the `packages.json` file. This allows you (or your teammates) to
automatically install missing packages with the `npm install` command.

If you're using any version control software such as
[git](http://git-scm.com/), now is a good time to make your initial commit.


## The Anatomy of Node Project

Right now the root directory of our Node project should look something like this:

```bash
app.js
bin/
node_modules/
package.json
public/
routes/
views/
```

Let's go step by step and explain what each folder/file is:

* `app.js` - This file is the launching point for our app. We use it to import
  all other server files including modules, configure routes, open database
connections, and just about anything else we can think of.

* `bin/` - This directory is used to contain useful executable scripts. By
  default it contains one called `www`. A quick peak inside reveals that this
script actually includes `app.js` and when invoked, starts our Node.js server.

* `node_modules` - This directory is home to all external modules used in the
  project.  As mentioned earlier, these modules are usually installed using
`npm install`. You will most likely not have to touch anything here.

* `package.json` - This file defines a JSON object that contains various
  properties of our project including things such as name and version number.
It can also defined what versions of Node are required and what modules our
project depends on. A list of [possible
options](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/package.json.html) can be found in npm's
documentation.

* `public/` - As the name alludes to, anything in this folder will be made
  publicly available by the server. This is where we're going to store
JavaScript, CSS, images, and templates we want the client to use.

* `routes/` - This directory houses our Node controllers and is usually where
  most of the backend code will be stored.

* `views/` - As the name says, we will put our views here. Because we specified
  the `--ejs` flag when initializing our project, views will have the `.ejs`
extension as opposed to the '.jade' extension Jade views use.  Although views
are ultimately HTML, they are slightly different than any HTML file we might
specify in the `public/` directory. Views are capable of being rendered
directly by Node using the `render()` function and can contain logic that
allows the server to dynamically change the content. Because we are using
Angular to create a dynamic experience, we won't be using this feature.

In addition to the above files structure, we are going to add one more folder.


{x: create models folder}
Create a new folder called 'models':

```bash
mkdir models
```

This folder will contain our Mongoose schema definitions.


## Importing Our Angular Project

The final step before we begin building out the backend is to import our
Angular portion into our Node.js project. First move the `index.html` file to
the `views/` directory.  Because we're using the *ejs* engine, Node is looking
for files with the `.ejs` extension so we're going to have to rename our
`index.html` to `index.ejs`, replacing the existing one.

Next, move the Angular `app.js` file to the `public/javascripts/` directory. To
avoid confusion with Node's `app.js`, also rename the Angular file to
`angularApp.js`.

Finally let's update the `<script>` tag in our `index.ejs` file to reflect
these changes:

```html
<script src="/javascripts/angularApp.js"></script>
```

Now we can start our application by running `npm start`.

If we point our browser to http://localhost:3000 we should be greeted with our
Angular application.


{x: add angular to node}
Add our existing Angular code to the node project



# Creating Schemas With Mongoose

{video: ch-8}


Our first step in making a persistent data store is to configure our data
models. To do this, we are going to be adding a schema layer on top of
MongoDB using a nice library called Mongoose. Before we begin, let's
make sure our MongoDB server is running.


{x: start mongo}
If Mongo isn't running on your machine, enter this into your terminal:

```bash
mongod &
```

Next, we need to tell Node to connect to our local database on start.


{x: connect to mongo}
Connect to our local MongoDB instance by adding the following code into our `app.js` file.:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/news');

...
var routes = require('./routes/index');
```
Make sure to add this before `var routes = require('./routes/index');` otherwise your get a MissingSchemaRrror.
This will open a connection with the `news` database running on our Mongo
server. Now we can create our first model.


{x: post schema}
In our `models/` directory create a new file called `Posts.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  link: String,
  upvotes: {type: Number, default: 0},
  comments: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Comment' }]
});

mongoose.model('Post', PostSchema);
```

Here we've defined a model called `Post` with several attributes corresponding
to the type of data we'd like to store. We've declared our `upvotes` field to
be initialized to 0 and we've set our `comments` field to an array of `Comment`
references. This will allow us to use Mongoose's build in [populate()][mongoose
populate] method to easily retrieve all comments associated with a given
`post`.

Next we register that model with with the global `mongoose` object we imported
using `require()` so that it can be used to interact with the database anywhere
else `mongoose` is imported.


{x: register post schema}
In `app.js`, add the following line of code before our `mongoose.connect` call:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
require('./models/Posts');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/news');
```


{x: comment schema}
While were on the topic of making models, let's create a second model for
storing comments in `models/Comments.js`:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var CommentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  body: String,
  author: String,
  upvotes: {type: Number, default: 0},
  post: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' }
});

mongoose.model('Comment', CommentSchema);
```

In Mongoose, we can create relationships between different data models using
the [ObjectId][mongoose objectid] type. The `ObjectId` data type refers to a 12
byte [MongoDB ObjectId][mongo objectid], which is actually what is stored in
the database. The `ref` property tells Mongoose what type of object the ID
references and enables us to retrieve both items simultaneously.


{x: register comments schema}
As always when you add a new file, remember to include it in `app.js`. Include this line of code right after the `require` for our Posts schema:

```javascript
require('./models/Comments');
```


# Opening REST Routes

{video: ch-9}


With our backend models in place, it's now time to open some routes that the
frontend client can interact with. The following are a list of actions a user
can perform:

* view all posts
* Add a new post
* upvote a post
* view comments associated with a post
* add a comment
* upvote a comment

The actions map directly to several routes, which are described as follows:

* GET /posts - return a list of posts and associated metadata
* POST /posts - create a new post
* GET /posts/:id - return an individual post with associated comments
* PUT /posts/:id/upvote - upvote a post, notice we use the post ID in the URL
* POST /posts/:id/comments - add a new comment to a post by ID
* PUT /posts/:id/comments/:id/upvote - upvote a comment


### Creating Our First Route

To keep things simple we will be defining these routes in the `routes/index.js`
file. Let's begin by opening up the first route we listed, which should return
a JSON list containing all `posts`.


{x: get posts}
Start by creating a *GET* route for retrieving posts in `routes/index.js`. It should return a JSON list containing all `posts`:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Post = mongoose.model('Post');
var Comment = mongoose.model('Comment');

router.get('/posts', function(req, res, next) {
  Post.find(function(err, posts){
    if(err){ return next(err); }

    res.json(posts);
  });
});
```

First, we need to make sure that `mongoose` is imported and that we have
handles to the `Post` and `Comment` models. Then we use the express
[get()][express get] method to define the URL for the route (`/posts`) and a
function to handle the request. Inside our request handler, we query the
database for all posts. If and error occurred, we pass the error to an error
handling function otherwise we use [res.json()][express json] to send the
retrieved posts back to the client.

{info}
When defining routes with Express.js, two variables will get passed to the
handler function. `req`, which stands for "request", contains all the
information about the request that was made to the server including data
fields. `res`, which stands for "response", is the object used to respond to
the client.


{x: create posts}
Before we can test that this route works, we need to have some data in our
database. We can do this by creating a *POST* route for creating posts:

Notice that we're using router.post instead of router.get. This means that we will be making a POST request to the server (not to be confused with our Flapper News 'post' models and routes).

```javascript
router.post('/posts', function(req, res, next) {
  var post = new Post(req.body);

  post.save(function(err, post){
    if(err){ return next(err); }

    res.json(post);
  });
});
```

The structure of the route is similar as above, however, we are using the
`post()` method. We are also using `mongoose` to create a new `post` object in
memory before saving it to the database.


## Testing the Initial Routes

We can test these two routes using a command line tool called
[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/).


{x: test create post}
First, we create a new `post`:

```sh
curl --data 'title=test&link=http://test.com' http://localhost:3000/posts
```


{x: test get post}
Next, we query the index route to insure it was saved:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/posts
```

If everything is functioning properly, you should see a JSON array of size 1
printed on the console with `title` and `link` set to 'test' and
'http://test.com' respectively.


## Pre-loading Objects

One thing you might notice about the remaining routes we need to implement is
that they all require us to load a `post` object by ID. Rather than replicating
the same code across several different request handler functions, we can use
Express's [param()][express param] function to automatically load an object.


{x: preload posts route}
Create a route for preloading `post` objects in `routes/index.js`:

```javascript
router.param('post', function(req, res, next, id) {
  var query = Post.findById(id);

  query.exec(function (err, post){
    if (err) { return next(err); }
    if (!post) { return next(new Error('can\'t find post')); }

    req.post = post;
    return next();
  });
});
```

In this example we are using mongoose's [query interface][mongoose query]
which simply provides a more flexible way of interacting with the database.

Now when we define a route URL with `:post` in it, this function will be run
first. Assuming the `:post` parameter contains an ID, our function will
retrieve the `post` object from the database and attach it to the `req` object
after which the route handler function will be called.


{x: get single post}
To demonstrate this, let's go ahead and create our route for returning a single post:

```javascript
router.get('/posts/:post', function(req, res) {
  res.json(req.post);
});
```

Because the post object was retrieved using the middleware function and
attached to the `req` object, all our request handler has to do is return the
JSON back to the client.


{x: mongoose query docs}
(optional) Check out the query interface docs for Mongoose

## Upvoting Posts

Now let's implement the route to allow our users to upvote posts.  We'll do
this by implementing a simple method in our `posts` schema to add one to the
upvote count then save it.


{x: upvote post schema method}
Add an `upvote()` method to the `Posts` schema in `Posts.js`:

```javascript
PostSchema.methods.upvote = function(cb) {
  this.upvotes += 1;
  this.save(cb);
};
```


{x: upvote post route}
Now we create the route in our `index.js`:

```javascript
router.put('/posts/:post/upvote', function(req, res, next) {
  req.post.upvote(function(err, post){
    if (err) { return next(err); }

    res.json(post);
  });
});
```


{x: test upvote post}
To test this route, simply create a new post using the command above then run

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/posts/<POST ID>/upvote
```

You should see the post value returned back with the `upvote` property
incremented.


## Finishing Off With Comments

We've now completed all the basic routes for our `posts` object, now all we
need to do is do the same for `comments`. Many of the same concepts apply
with a few slight variations.

Firstly, when creating a new comment we need to be sure to include the `post`
ID. Fortunately, this is already implicitly included in the request. In
addition to creating and saving the `comment`, we're going to need to attach a
reference to the new `comment` that refers to our `post` object.


{x: create comment route}
Create `comments` route for a particular `post`:

```javascript
router.post('/posts/:post/comments', function(req, res, next) {
  var comment = new Comment(req.body);
  comment.post = req.post;

  comment.save(function(err, comment){
    if(err){ return next(err); }

    req.post.comments.push(comment);
    req.post.save(function(err, post) {
      if(err){ return next(err); }

      res.json(comment);
    });
  });
});
```


Now, we can also take the exact same `upvote` method from `posts` and apply
it to `comments`.

{x: comment upvotes}
Implement the `/posts/:post/comments/:comment/upvote` route yourself. You
should also implement another `router.param()` middleware function to automatically
retrieve comments specified by the `:comment` route parameter.


Finally, we need to make a slight modification to our `GET /posts/:post` route

{x: populate function}
Use the `populate()` function to retrieve `comments` along with `posts`:

```javascript
router.get('/posts/:post', function(req, res, next) {
  req.post.populate('comments', function(err, post) {
    if (err) { return next(err); }

    res.json(post);
  });
});
```
Using the `populate()` method, we can automatically load all the comments
associated with that particular `post`.

Congratulations! If you made it this far, you should now have a functioning
backend. There is still a significant amount of additional functionality
we could add, however, you should now understand some of the basics of
Node, Express, and Mongoose.

Up next, we'll learn how to use these routes in conjunction with our
Angular.js frontend to create a web app where people can create `posts`
and add `comments`.

# Wiring Everything Up

{video: ch-10}

Now that we have our basic backend implemented, we're going to wire up the
angular app we made in the first part of this tutorial.

## Loading Posts

Our first step is going to be to query our new backend for all `posts` using
the index route. We do this by adding a new function inside our `posts`
service.


{x: get all posts}
Implement `getAll()` to retrieve posts in the `posts` service within `angularApp.js`:

```javascript
  o.getAll = function() {
    return $http.get('/posts').success(function(data){
      angular.copy(data, o.posts);
    });
  };
```

{info}
It's important to use the [angular.copy()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.copy) method to create a deep copy of the returned data. This ensures
that the `$scope.posts` variable in `MainCtrl` will also be updated, ensuring
the new values are reflect in our view.


{x: inject http}
Also be sure to inject the `$http` service:

```javascript
app.factory('posts', ['$http', function($http){
  ...
});
```

In this function we're using the Angular [$http][ng http] service to query our
`posts` route. The `success()` function allows us to bind function that will be
executed when the request returns. Because our route will return a list of
`posts`, all we need to do is copy that list to the client side `posts` object.
Notice that we're using the [angular.copy()][ng copy] function to do this as it
will make our UI update properly.

Now we need to call this function at an appropriate time to load the data. We
do this by adding a property called [resolve][ui resolve] to our `home` state.


{x: resolve ui-router}
Use the `resolve` property of `ui-router` to ensure posts are loaded:

```javascript
.state('home', {
  url: '/home',
  templateUrl: '/home.html',
  controller: 'MainCtrl',
  resolve: {
    postPromise: ['posts', function(posts){
      return posts.getAll();
    }]
  }
})
```

By using the `resolve` property in this way, we are ensuring that anytime our
`home` state is entered, we will automatically query all posts from our
backend before the state actually finishes loading.

Now, when you fire up the server and go to http://localhost:3000/#/home, you
should see all the posts that exist in the database.

## Creating New Posts

Up next, we need to enable creating new `posts`. As with loading posts, we're
going to do this by adding another method to our `posts` service:


{x: create new posts service}
Add a method for creating new posts:

```javascript
o.create = function(post) {
  return $http.post('/posts', post).success(function(data){
    o.posts.push(data);
  });
};
```


{x: save post to server}
Now we can modify the `$scope.addPost()` method in `MainCtrl` to save `posts` to the server:

```javascript
$scope.addPost = function(){
  if(!$scope.title || $scope.title === '') { return; }
  posts.create({
    title: $scope.title,
    link: $scope.link,
  });
  $scope.title = '';
  $scope.link = '';
};
```

Refresh the page then try adding a new post. You should immediately see it
displayed and if you refresh the page, the post is still there! We now have
persistent data.


## Upvoting Posts

The last thing we need to wire up on the main page is upvoting posts.


{x: frontend upvote service}
Like in the previous examples, we'll add another method to our service:

```javascript
o.upvote = function(post) {
  return $http.put('/posts/' + post._id + '/upvote')
    .success(function(data){
      post.upvotes += 1;
    });
};
```

{x: frontend upvote scope}
And then in our controller, we simply replace `incrementUpvotes()` with this:

```javascript
$scope.incrementUpvotes = function(post) {
  posts.upvote(post);
};
```

Here we use the `put()` method to upvote a `post`. When the call returns
successfully, we update our local copy to reflect the changes. Now when you
refresh the page, upvotes are persisted.


## Finishing Off Comments

If you remember back to when we first wrote the template, we were treating the
index of a `post` in the `posts` array to be its `id` field.  Now that we are
actually dealing with database entries, we need to make sure that when you
click on the "Comments" link for a post, the application directs you to the
proper URL.


{x: comments link to correct route}
Modify the `Comments` link to point to the proper route:

```html
<a href="#/posts/{{post._id}}">Comments</a>
```

{info}
MongoDB uses the `_id` property natively, so it's usually easier to just write
our application with that in mind rather than have to translate it to an `id`
field, which some might consider more intuitive.

When you click on the "Comments" link for a post, you should be directed to a
new Angular URL that might look something like
`http://localhost:3000/#/posts/53e27c7c363cf85ad8a84723`

What we are going to do is have Angular automatically load the full `post`
object with `comments` when we enter this state. Like we did with the `home`
state, we're going to use the `resolve` property in the route to accomplish this.


{x: retrieve single post angular}
First, lets add a simple method in our `posts` service to retrieve a single
`post` from our server:

```javascript
o.get = function(id) {
  return $http.get('/posts/' + id).then(function(res){
    return res.data;
  });
};
```

Notice that instead of using the `success()` method we have traditionally used,
we are instead using a [promise](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q).


{x: resolve for posts route}
Next we add the `resolve` object to our `posts` state:

```javascript
.state('posts', {
  url: '/posts/{id}',
  templateUrl: '/posts.html',
  controller: 'PostsCtrl',
  resolve: {
    post: ['$stateParams', 'posts', function($stateParams, posts) {
      return posts.get($stateParams.id);
    }]
  }
});
```

The Angular ui-router detects we are entering the `posts` state and will then
automatically query the server for the full post object, including `comments`.
Only after the request has returned will the state finish loading.

To get access to the `post` object we just retrieved in the `PostsCtrl`, instead
of going through the `posts` service, the specific object will be directly injected
into our `PostsCtrl`.


{x: inject a post}
We can modify our controller to gain access to it like so:

```javascript
app.controller('PostsCtrl', [
'$scope',
'posts',
'post',
function($scope, posts, post){
  $scope.post = post;

  ...
});
```

Notice that we no longer have need to inject `$stateParams` into our
controller. We're still going to want to inject `posts` to gain access to the
methods for manipulating `comments`, however.

When you refresh the page, you should now see the title of the post displayed.

To enable adding `comments`, we can use the same technique we used for adding
new `posts`.


{x: add comment service}
First add a method to the `posts` service:

```javascript
o.addComment = function(id, comment) {
  return $http.post('/posts/' + id + '/comments', comment);
};
```


{x: add comment scope}
Then call it from within the existing `addComment()` function:

```javascript
$scope.addComment = function(){
  if($scope.body === '') { return; }
  posts.addComment(post._id, {
    body: $scope.body,
    author: 'user',
  }).success(function(comment) {
    $scope.post.comments.push(comment);
  });
  $scope.body = '';
};
```

Now you can add a comment that's persisted to the database.


{x: enable comment upvoting service}
Our final task is to enable the upvoting of comments:

```javascript
o.upvoteComment = function(post, comment) {
  return $http.put('/posts/' + post._id + '/comments/'+ comment._id + '/upvote')
    .success(function(data){
      comment.upvotes += 1;
    });
};
```

In `PostsCtrl`:

```javascript
$scope.incrementUpvotes = function(comment){
  posts.upvoteComment(post, comment);
};
```


# Adding Authentication via Passport

Now that we have a application with a working server and client, let's add in
the ability to create and authenticate users. To do this, we'll be using
[passport](http://passportjs.org/) for authentications and JWT tokens for
session management. [This
post](https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/)
has some great information about token vs session based authentication.

## Creating the User model
{video: create-user-model}
{x: create mongoose user}
Start by creating a mongoose model for our Users with the following code in `models/Users.js`:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {type: String, lowercase: true, unique: true},
  hash: String,
  salt: String
});

mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Our users will be logging in with a username and password. Since we don't want
to store our passwords in plain text, we'll need a field for storing the hash
of the password. We'll also be generating and saving a salt whenever we set the
password.

Now let's implement setting and validating passwords. We'll be using the
`pbkdf2()` function which ships with node's native `crypto` module to hash our
passwords.

{x: require crypto user}
Require the crypto module in our user model.

```javascript
var crypto = require('crypto');
```

{x: create setPassword}
Create a `setPassword()` method on the `User` model
that accepts a password then generates a salt and associated password hash.

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.setPassword = function(password){
  this.salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');

  this.hash = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, this.salt, 1000, 64).toString('hex');
};
```

{info}
The `pbkdf2Sync()` function takes four parameters: password, salt, iterations,
and key length. We'll need to make sure the iterations and key length in our
`setPassword()` method match the ones in our `validPassword()` method

{x: create validPassword}
Create a `validPassword()` method that accepts a password and compares it to the
hash stored, returning a boolean.

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.validPassword = function(password) {
  var hash = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, this.salt, 1000, 64).toString('hex');

  return this.hash === hash;
};
```

Finally, let's create instance method for generating a JWT token for the
`user`. We'll be using the `jsonwebtoken()` module to help us generate tokens.

{x: npm install jsonwebtoken}
Install the `jsonwebtoken` module via `npm`.

```
npm install jsonwebtoken --save
```

{x: require jsonwebtoken}
Require the `jsonwebtoken` module inside the User model.

```javascript
var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
```

{x: create generateJWT method}
Create the `generateJWT()` instance method on `UserSchema` with the following
code:

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.generateJWT = function() {

  // set expiration to 60 days
  var today = new Date();
  var exp = new Date(today);
  exp.setDate(today.getDate() + 60);

  return jwt.sign({
    _id: this._id,
    username: this.username,
    exp: parseInt(exp.getTime() / 1000)
  }, 'SECRET');
};
```

{info}
The first argument of the `jwt.sign()` method is the payload that gets signed.
Both the server and client will have access to the payload. The `exp` value in
the payload is a Unix timestamp in seconds that will specify when the token
expires. For this example we set it to 60 days in the future. The second
argument of `jwt.sign()` is the secret used to sign our tokens. We're
hard-coding it in this example, but it is **_strongly recommended_** that you
use an environment variable for referencing the secret and keep it out of your
codebase.

## Setting up Passport

{video: setting-up-passport}

Now that we have our methods in place on our `UserSchema` for creating and
authenticating users, let's install and setup Passport in our application.
Passport uses strategies for different authentication methods (password, GitHub,
Facebook, etc.) that are split out into separate modules. We'll be using the
`passport-local` strategy to handle username/password authentication. See the
[official Passport guide](http://passportjs.org/guide/) for more information
about Passport.

{x: npm install passport passport-local}
Install `passport` and `passport-local` via `npm`.

```
npm install passport passport-local --save
```

{x: create config folder}
Create a folder `config` in the root of our application.

{x: create config passport}
Create `config/passport.js` with the following code:

```javascript
var passport = require('passport');
var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var User = mongoose.model('User');

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
  function(username, password, done) {
    User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
      if (err) { return done(err); }
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });
      }
      if (!user.validPassword(password)) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' });
      }
      return done(null, user);
    });
  }
));

```

{info}
Here we create a new `LocalStrategy` where we have our logic on how to
authenticate a user given a username and password. Note that this function
calls the `validPassword()` function that we just created. See the [official
passport configuration guide](http://passportjs.org/guide/configure/) for more
information.


## Adding Passport to Our Application

Now that we have a configuration file for passport ready to use, let's
incorporate it into our application.

{x: require passport appjs}
Require passport in `app.js` after where we required `mongoose`

```javascript
var passport = require('passport');
```

{x: require users model}
Require the user model after where we required `Post` and `Comment` models

```javascript
require('./models/Users');
```

{x: require passport config}
Require the passport configuration we just created **after** where we required
our `User` model.

```javascript
require('./config/passport');
```
{x: initialize passport}
Initialize passport after the `express.static` middleware.

```javascript
app.use(passport.initialize());
```

## Creating Authentication Endpoints

{video: create-auth-routes}

Now that Passport is setup in our application, we can create a `/login`
endpoint to authenticate our users and return a JWT token.

{x: create register route}
Add a `/register` route to `routes/index.js` that creates a user given a
username and password:

```javascript
router.post('/register', function(req, res, next){
  if(!req.body.username || !req.body.password){
    return res.status(400).json({message: 'Please fill out all fields'});
  }

  var user = new User();

  user.username = req.body.username;

  user.setPassword(req.body.password)

  user.save(function (err){
    if(err){ return next(err); }

    return res.json({token: user.generateJWT()})
  });
});
```

{x: require passport routes index}
Require `passport` in `routes/index.js`

```javascript
var passport = require('passport');
```

{x: import user model}
Import the `User` mongoose model

```
var User = mongoose.model('User');
```

{x: create login route}
Add a `/login` route to `routes/index.js` that authenticates the user and
returns a token to the client:

```javascript
router.post('/login', function(req, res, next){
  if(!req.body.username || !req.body.password){
    return res.status(400).json({message: 'Please fill out all fields'});
  }

  passport.authenticate('local', function(err, user, info){
    if(err){ return next(err); }

    if(user){
      return res.json({token: user.generateJWT()});
    } else {
      return res.status(401).json(info);
    }
  })(req, res, next);
});
```

The `passport.authenticate('local')` middleware uses the `LocalStrategy` we
created earlier. We're using a custom callback for the `authenticate`
middleware so we can return error messages to the client. If authentication is
successful we want to return a JWT token to the client just like our register
route does.


## Securing Endpoints and Associating Posts and Comments with Users

{x: install express-jwt}
Install the `express-jwt` module via `npm`.

```
npm install express-jwt --save
```

{x: require express-jwt}
Require `express-jwt` in `routes/index.js`

```javascript
var jwt = require('express-jwt');
```

{x: create auth middleware}
Create a middleware for authenticating jwt tokens in `routes/index.js`:

```javascript
var auth = jwt({secret: 'SECRET', userProperty: 'payload'});

```

The `userPropery` option specifies which property on `req` to put our payload
from our tokens. By default it's set on `user` but we're using `payload`
instead to avoid any conflicts with passport (it shouldn't be an issue since we
aren't using both methods of authentication in the same request). This also
avoids confusion since the payload isn't an instance of our User model.


{info}
Make sure to use the same secret as the one in `models/User.js` for generating
tokens. Again, we're hard-coding the token in this example but it is *_strongly
recommended_* that you use an environment variable for referencing your secret.

Now we can use the middleware we just defined to require authentication on
specific routes. In our case, we'd want to authenticate users whenever they try
to write to our application, such as when they're posting or commenting.

{x: require auth create post}
Require authentication for creating a post

```javascript
router.post('/posts', auth, function(req, res, next) {

```

{x: require auth upvote post}
Require authentication for upvoting

```javascript
router.put('/posts/:post/upvote', auth, function(req, res, next) {
```

{x: require auth commenting}
Require authentication for commenting and set the author for comments

```javascript
router.post('/posts/:post/comments', auth, function(req, res, next) {
```

{x: require auth upvote comment}
Require Authentication for upvoting comments

```javascript
router.put('/posts/:post/comments/:comment/upvote', auth, function(req, res, next) {
```

Finally, let's associate the authors with their posts and comments. Since we're
authenticating with JWT tokens, we can get the username directly from the
token's payload, saving us a trip to the database.

{x: associate post authors}
Set the author field when creating posts

```javascript
router.post('/posts', auth, function(req, res, next) {
  var post = new Post(req.body);
  post.author = req.payload.username;
```

{x: associate comment authors}
Set the author field when creating comments

```javascript
router.post('/posts/:post/comments', auth, function(req, res, next) {
  var comment = new Comment(req.body);
  comment.post = req.post;
  comment.author = req.payload.username;
```

Now that our backend is ready to register and authenticate users, let's update
the angular side of our application to handle this.


## Creating an Angular Service for Authentication

{video: wiring-frontend}

We'll be using localStorage for persisting data to the client. This gives us
a much easier interface for persisting data across sessions without having to
deal with parsing cookies or handling cookies across multiple domains. If a
JWT token exists in localStorage, we can assume the user is logged in as long
as the token isn't expired. To log a user out, simply remove the token from
localStorage. Check out the [localStorage documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage#localStorage)
for a better understanding of localStorage.

{x: create auth factory}
Let's start out by creating our initial auth factory. We'll need to inject
`$http` for interfacing with our server, and `$window` for interfacing with
`localStorage`.

```javascript
.factory('auth', ['$http', '$window', function($http, $window){
   var auth = {};

  return auth;
}])

```

{x: create auth savetoken}
Next, let's create a `saveToken` and `getToken` function in our factory for
getting and setting our token to `localStorage`

```javascript
auth.saveToken = function (token){
  $window.localStorage['flapper-news-token'] = token;
};

auth.getToken = function (){
  return $window.localStorage['flapper-news-token'];
}
```

{x: create auth isloggedin}
Now we'll need to add a function `isLoggedIn()` to our `auth` factory to
return a boolean value for if the user is logged in.

```javascript
auth.isLoggedIn = function(){
  var token = auth.getToken();

  if(token){
    var payload = JSON.parse($window.atob(token.split('.')[1]));

    return payload.exp > Date.now() / 1000;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

If a token exists, we'll need to check the payload to see if the token has
expired, otherwise we can assume the user is logged out. The payload is the
middle part of the token between the two `.`s. It's a JSON object that has been
base64'd. We can get it back to a stringified JSON by using `$window.atob()`, and
then back to a javascript object with `JSON.parse`.

{x: create auth currentuser}
Let's create a function `currentUser()` that returns the username of the user that's
logged in.

```javascript
auth.currentUser = function(){
  if(auth.isLoggedIn()){
    var token = auth.getToken();
    var payload = JSON.parse($window.atob(token.split('.')[1]));

    return payload.username;
  }
};
```

Finally, we'll need methods to log in, register, and log users out.

{x: create auth register}
Create a register function that posts a user to our `/register` route and saves
the token returned.

```javascript
auth.register = function(user){
  return $http.post('/register', user).success(function(data){
    auth.saveToken(data.token);
  });
};
```

{x: create auth login}
Create a login function that posts a user to our `/login` route and saves the
token returned.

```javascript
auth.logIn = function(user){
  return $http.post('/login', user).success(function(data){
    auth.saveToken(data.token);
  });
};
```

{x: create auth log out}
Create a logout function that removes the user's token from localStorage,
logging the user out.

```javascript
auth.logOut = function(){
  $window.localStorage.removeItem('flapper-news-token');
};
```


## Creating the Login and Register pages

{video: auth-controllers}

Now that our authentication factory is complete we can start using it in our
application. Let's create a controller for our login and register page.

{x: create auth controller}
Create an authentication controller with the following code:

```javascript
.controller('AuthCtrl', [
'$scope',
'$state',
'auth',
function($scope, $state, auth){
  $scope.user = {};

  $scope.register = function(){
    auth.register($scope.user).error(function(error){
      $scope.error = error;
    }).then(function(){
      $state.go('home');
    });
  };

  $scope.logIn = function(){
    auth.logIn($scope.user).error(function(error){
      $scope.error = error;
    }).then(function(){
      $state.go('home');
    });
  };
}])
```

We need to initialize a user on `$scope` for our form. Then, we can create
a `register` and `logIn()` method on `$scope` to call the respective methods on
the auth factory. We can then handle any errors and set `$scope.error` for
displaying error messages later. Finally, if no errors occur, we can send the
user back to the `home` state using a promise. Now we can go ahead and create
our login and registration templates


{x: create register template}
Create the following registration template in `views/index.ejs`:

 ```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="/register.html">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Flapper News</h1>
  </div>

  <div ng-show="error" class="alert alert-danger row">
    <span>{{ error.message }}</span>
  </div>

  <form ng-submit="register()"
    style="margin-top:30px;">
    <h3>Register</h3>

    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="text"
      class="form-control"
      placeholder="Username"
      ng-model="user.username"></input>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="password"
      class="form-control"
      placeholder="Password"
      ng-model="user.password"></input>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Register</button>
  </form>
</script>
```

{x: create login template}
Create the following login template in `views/index.ejs`:

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="/login.html">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Flapper News</h1>
  </div>

  <div ng-show="error" class="alert alert-danger row">
    <span>{{ error.message }}</span>
  </div>

  <form ng-submit="logIn()"
    style="margin-top:30px;">
    <h3>Log In</h3>

    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="text"
      class="form-control"
      placeholder="Username"
      ng-model="user.username"></input>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="password"
      class="form-control"
      placeholder="Password"
      ng-model="user.password"></input>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Log In</button>
  </form>
  </script>
```

Finally, let's add two new states that make our login and register pages
accessible:

{x: create login register states}
Create two new states for the login and register page:

```javascript
.state('login', {
  url: '/login',
  templateUrl: '/login.html',
  controller: 'AuthCtrl',
  onEnter: ['$state', 'auth', function($state, auth){
    if(auth.isLoggedIn()){
      $state.go('home');
    }
  }]
})
.state('register', {
  url: '/register',
  templateUrl: '/register.html',
  controller: 'AuthCtrl',
  onEnter: ['$state', 'auth', function($state, auth){
    if(auth.isLoggedIn()){
      $state.go('home');
    }
  }]
});
```

Here we're specifying an `onEnter` function to our states. This gives us the
ability to detect if the user is authenticated before entering the state, which
allows us to redirect them back to the `home` state if they're already logged
in.

## Adding Navigation

Let's add a navbar to our application so we can easily tell if the user is
logged in or not.

{x: create nav ctrl}
Start by making a simple controller for our navbar that exposes the
`isLoggedIn`, `currentUser`, and `logOut` methods from our `auth` factory.

```javascript
.controller('NavCtrl', [
'$scope',
'auth',
function($scope, auth){
  $scope.isLoggedIn = auth.isLoggedIn;
  $scope.currentUser = auth.currentUser;
  $scope.logOut = auth.logOut;
}]);
```

{x: add nav tpl}
Now we can add the markup for our navbar to our application:

```html
<body ng-app="flapperNews">
  <nav class="navbar navbar-default pull-right" ng-controller="NavCtrl">
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      <li ng-show="isLoggedIn()"><a>{{ currentUser() }}</a></li>
      <li ng-show="isLoggedIn()"><a href="" ng-click="logOut()">Log Out</a></li>
      <li ng-hide="isLoggedIn()"><a href="/#/login">Log In</a></li>
      <li ng-hide="isLoggedIn()"><a href="/#/register">Register</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
```

We're using `ng-show` and `ng-hide` along with our `isLoggedIn()` function to
determine if the user is authenticated. If they are, their username is
displayed, along with a log out link which calls our `logOut()` function.
If they aren't, a Log In and a Register link is shown instead.

## Making the Rest of Our Application User-Aware

Since our routes that write to the database now require authentication, let's
update our `posts` service to send the JWT token to the server on authenticated
requests.

{x: inject auth to posts}
First, we'll need to inject the `auth` service to our `posts` service

```javascript
.factory('posts', ['$http', 'auth', function($http, auth){
```

Next, we'll need to send up our JWT token as an `Authorization` header. The
format for this header should be `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN.GOES.HERE`.

{x: add auth header to requests}
We'll need to pass the following object as the last argument for our `$http`
calls for the `create`, `upvote`, `addComment`, and `upvoteComment` methods in
our `posts` service:

```javascript
o.create = function(post) {
  return $http.post('/posts', post, {
    headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer '+auth.getToken()}
  }).success(function(data){
    o.posts.push(data);
  });
};

o.upvote = function(post) {
  return $http.put('/posts/' + post._id + '/upvote', null, {
    headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer '+auth.getToken()}
  }).success(function(data){
    post.upvotes += 1;
  });
};

o.addComment = function(id, comment) {
  return $http.post('/posts/' + id + '/comments', comment, {
    headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer '+auth.getToken()}
  });
};

o.upvoteComment = function(post, comment) {
  return $http.put('/posts/' + post._id + '/comments/'+ comment._id + '/upvote', null, {
    headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer '+auth.getToken()}
  }).success(function(data){
    comment.upvotes += 1;
  });
};
```

{x: add author to posts}
We can now display the post authors in the `/home.html` template:

```html
<span ng-show="post.author">
  posted by <a>{{post.author}}</a> |
</span>
```

We only want to show the add post and add comment forms if the user is logged
in. To do this, our controllers need to be aware of the authentication state.

{x: expose isloggedin post comments}
We'll want to inject `auth` into *both* `MainCtrl` and `PostsCtrl`, and expose
the `isLoggedIn` method to `$scope`

```javascript
$scope.isLoggedIn = auth.isLoggedIn;
```

{x: hide post form}
Now we're able to only show the post form to authenticated users:

```html
<form ng-submit="addPost()"
  ng-show="isLoggedIn()"
  style="margin-top:30px;">
```

{x: show signup msg post}
And display a message to users who aren't signed in

```html
<div ng-hide="isLoggedIn()">
  <h3>You need to <a href="/#/login">Log In</a> or <a href="/#/register">Register</a> before you can add a post.</h3>
</div>
```

{x: hide comment form}
Finally, hide the comment form for unauthenticated users:

```html
<form ng-submit="addComment()"
  ng-show="isLoggedIn()"
  style="margin-top:30px;">
```

{x: show auth msg comments}
And prompt them to log in or sign up instead

```html
<div ng-hide="isLoggedIn()">
  <h3>You need to <a href="/#/login">Log In</a> or <a href="/#/register">Register</a> before you can comment.</h3>
</div>
```

We now have an application with authentication!

# Where To Go Next

Throughout this tutorial we've seen what a basic MEAN app might look like by
creating a basic Angular application with a persistent Node+Express backend.
By now, you should hopefully have an understanding of how these technologies
interact as well as the ability to make modifications and add new features. If
you're looking to sharpen your skills through practice, here are some
suggestions on modifications you can add to Flapper News:

- feature downvote: Implement a 'downvoting' feature
- feature vote once: Only allow authenticated users to vote once.
- feature number of comments: Display the number of comments next to each post
  on the main page
- feature hide new comments box: use `ng-hide` to hide the 'new comment' and
  'new post' input box until a user clicks a button to see the field
- feature specify name when commenting: Create an 'Author' field so people can
  specify their name when commenting
